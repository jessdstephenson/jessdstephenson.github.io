Hi, I’m Jess Stephenson — a M.S. Student in the Applied Statistics for Social Science Program at New York University. 

my research interests sit at the intersection of social psychology, moral philosophy, linguisitics, and technology. I’m especially interested in how people interpret algorithmic decisions, what fairness and responsibility mean in automated systems, and how data practices and language reflect and reproduce social power.

By day, I coordinate multi-lab participant recruitment for BabyChildTeen@NYU, supporting developmental psychology labs run more efficient, accessible research. I also teach undergraduate statistics at CUNY’s School of Labor and Urban Studies, where I focus on building data literacy through the lens of social justice.

I work primarily in R, and recent projects include investigating the role of pragmatics and generic language in children’s essentialist reasoning (with Marjorie Rhodes), theorizing about the limits of Bayesian models of inference, and analyzing how passive voice is used in news coverage of conflict to obscure agency.
