Hi, I’m Jessica Stephenson — my research interests lie at the intersection of data, ethics, and human behavior. I’m especially interested in how people make sense of algorithmic decisions, how these systems shape lived experiences, and how they can be redesigned with justice in mind. With a background in psychology and cognitive science, I approach questions about fairness and accountability through both empirical and conceptual lenses, drawing on tools from statistics, moral philosophy, and critical theory.

I’m particularly curious about how beliefs about objectivity, agency, and moral responsibility influence public trust in algorithmic systems — and how these perceptions differ across social contexts.
